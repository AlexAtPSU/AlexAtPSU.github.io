Took a small example of my week 2 portfolio and started from there

attempted to add a bootstrap for a sidebar
too much code made it look cluttered and didnt work good

already had a sidebar so i decided to use javascript to make it turn invisable with a button

using jquery i was able to make the sidebar hidden
it wont go back to visible though

remade the sidebar to look nicer. added hover changes to links

remade jquery function to toggle class to be two classes, one with hidden visibility

to the sidebar, fadein was added using css by animation. 

removed the margin on main section when sidebar is toggled
