Took a small example of my week 2 portfolio and started from there

attempted to add a bootstrap for a sidebar
too much code made it look cluttered and didnt work good

already had a sidebar so i decided to use javascript to make it turn invisable with a button

using jquery i was able to make the sidebar hidden
it wont go back to visible though

remade the sidebar to look nicer. added hover changes to links

remade jquery function to toggle class to be two classes, one with hidden visibility

to the sidebar, fadein was added using css by animation. 

removed the margin on main section when sidebar is toggled
Fixed a bug when toggling the sidebar that caused the css to get messed up.
it was a typo in the toggle class part.

Created a seperate html form for contacting. Then setup the contact tab on the sidebar to prepend it to the page.


Attempted to add an image carousel bootstrap. All my fonts went funky.

Added border to carousel to see where it was.
Changed some css and added pictures to the carousel to make sure it worked.

Changed the sidebar toggle button to look nicer. Round, colored it, etc.
Added an html entity (&raquo; which is an arrow in html) to make it look like an arrow and set a toggle in js.
Using jquery, after changing the value of the button it changes from the arrow to just the text "&raquo;" Sounds like a bug because the value should be the same still, an arrow....

Copy and pasted the unicode arrow itself into the javascript since the usual way didnt work.

Removed all the bootstrap and put it into its own html file.
because of that some of the css that looked fine now looks funny again.

created iframe to load carousel into main part of page.
changed some css. iframe height wont change though.

About and Contact buttons now change the iframe. Jquery
